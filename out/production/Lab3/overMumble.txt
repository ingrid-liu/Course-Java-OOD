Difference between Overloading and Overriding in Java:


1. Overloading is in the same class;
   Overriding is in a Class's child class, which is an implementation to the method inherited from its parent class;
2. From above, we know that Overloading happens at compile-time while Overriding happens at runtime;
3. Argument list is different while doing method Overloading;
   Argument list is the same in method Overriding.

Overloading in this lab3 case is providing us a way to achieve a default parameter value by setting two constructors,
one receives a given value to a specific argument while another one doesn't need to pass a value to it but already set
a value to that argument.
