0. initial outline of the final project idea
I and my partner want to create a Payroll System with the Java knowledge we learned from 5004.


1. The overall topic of the project (a game, an inventory database, a music
classifier, a tool to defeat "captcha"s involving stop lights, whatever), a
clever algorithm to traverse a certain type of tree -- whatever!). Try to
choose something that is authentically interesting to YOU.

A Payroll system.
It is a simple application using graphical components in the Swing toolkit in Java.
The feature of this simple application includes calculating total salary an employee.
In order to add a record, the user has to provide id, name, department, position, etc.

Ideally, we will try to make it switch to the employer mode and have more access to manage
the employee's payroll information.

2. Your likely partner(s), if any. Name(s) if known, ideal number if not.
My partner is Ryan Mah. We are a 2 person team.

3. Format (e.g., a desktop app, an Android app, a web site with an embedded
Java app? something else?).
Up to now we want the Payroll System to be pop out window of a Java app.(sorry, I'm not quite sure about this part now)

4. Your current best estimate of how many person-hours will be required to
complete your project, broken down as follows:
- defining: 6-8 hours
- designing: 10-12 hours;
- researching: 8-10 hours;
- implementing: 15-20 hours;
- testing: 15-20 hours;
- debugging: 20 hours;
- updating: 20+ hours;
and a GRAND TOTAL: 110+ hours in total

5. One thing you think you may need to learn in order to complete the project.
I hope I can use a database to implement the data my system restore, so if time allowed, I hope to
learn some knowledge on database!
