New updated:
We are working on figuring out the Swing package, seeing what we could do with it, and trying to come up with
ideas on how to continue. In addition, the module video we were supposed to watch for the lab
gave me great ideas on how to implement a Strategy Design Pattern into the back end code. This
will come in handy because we are designing a payroll program:)
