Three videos I’ve watched:

1. CS5004_M04_L02_Linked_Lists_And_Recursive_Structs
2. CS5004_M04_L15_Java_Arrays_And_Arraylists
3. CS5004_M04_L13_Java_Librarys_List_Interface_And_Linkedlist_Class

Since the midterm will be ‘Linked List’ related, so I chose some topics on Linked List.
I found that the videos are more systematically. It covered topics by different modules and 
explained profound theories in simple language.

I went over several basic concepts like reference, difference between array and linked list from these module videos.

And I’m still exploring why Java splits ADT into an interface and its powerful functions. Hope I can have a further understanding from my final projects.
